**STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR SETTING UP AND VERIFYING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PROJECT**

**Project Title:** Student Performance Prediction

**STREAMLIT LINK (TO SEE THE ML WEB APP DEPLOYED):** https://mlproject-davidetestiscorepredict.streamlit.app/

**Scope:** This project aims to predict a student's math score based on various input parameters such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The model has been trained on a dataset of student performance and utilizes various machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

**CLONING AND SETUP STEPS**

    Clone the Repository:

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlproject.git
        cd mlproject/mlproject


    Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    Install the Required Packages:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Project Setup Script:
    This script will install the dependencies and create the necessary artifacts (like the trained model, processed data, etc.).

        python project_setup.py

**DEPLOYMENT METHODS**

METHOD 1 FOR RUNNING THE APPLICATION LOCALLY
    Running the Application:

        python app.py

    Tests the endpoints 

        http://127.0.0.1:5000/
        http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata

METHOD 2 FOR RUNNING THE APPLICATION NOT LOCALLY VIA STREAMLIT

    Run the Application: Start the Streamlit application by executing the following command in your terminal:

        streamlit run app_streamlit.py

    Tests the web app on streamlit:
        
        https://mlproject-davidetestiscorepredict.streamlit.app/

METHOD 3 FOR RUNNING THE APPLICATION LOCALLY WITH DOCKER (WITHOUT STREAMLIT)

    Build the Docker Image (be sure to have docker engine on with Docker Desktop):

        docker build -t student-performance-prediction .

    Run the Docker Container:

        docker run -p 5000:5000 student-performance-prediction

    Tests the endpoints 

        http://localhost:5000/
        http://localhost:5000/predictdata
