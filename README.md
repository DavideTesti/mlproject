**Step-by-Step Guide for Setting Up and Running the Project**

Project Overview
Project Title: Student Performance Prediction

Scope: This project aims to predict a student's math score based on various input parameters such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The model has been trained on a dataset of student performance and utilizes various machine learning algorithms to make predictions.


Clone the Repository:

    copy code:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlproject.git
    cd mlproject/mlproject


Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

    copy code:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the Required Packages:

    copy code:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Run the Project Setup Script:
    This script will install the dependencies and create the necessary artifacts (like the trained model, processed data, etc.).

    copy code:
    python project_setup.py


METHOD 1 FOR RUNNING THE APPLICATION LOCALLY
Running the Application (if applicable):
If your project includes a web application or some other entry point, they can run it as follows:

    copy code:
    python app.py

tests the endponts 
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata


METHOD 2 FOR RUNNING THE APPLICATION NOT LOCALLY VIA STREAMLIT
Run the Application: Start the Streamlit application by executing the following command in your terminal:

    copy code:
    streamlit run app_streamlit.py
    This command will start a local server, and Streamlit will provide a URL (usually http://localhost:8501) that you can open in your web browser to view and interact with the app.
